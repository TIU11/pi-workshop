# Setup

Create an IFTTT Applet, https://ifttt.com/create
* *this*: Webhook to receive a web request
* *that*: Twitter "Post a tweet with an image"
* Remember the event name. We used 'create_post'.
* Remember the api_key.

Use the [example](example.py) to test your Applet.

Now setup the Raspberry Pi camera, and tweet some of your own pictures!
